# About EmuEmu
EmuEmu is a fork of emulator.js but made unblocked by the unbl0ckedfr team.
# Why?
The world is on its way to where the schools control the students and we are here to stop it!
# How?
We are fixing this issue by making proxies games and more. Our websites will have a cloak on them at all times to keep them hidden from the teachers. We are already working on a web index named "Torium" which will have games, proxies, movies, and more.
