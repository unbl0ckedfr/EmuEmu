# About EmuEmu
EmuEmu is a fork of emulator.js but made unblocked by the unbl0ckedfr team.
# Why?
The world is on its way to where the schools control the students and we are here to stop it!
# How?
We are fixing this issue by making proxies games and more. Our websites will have a cloak on them at all times to keep them hidden from the teachers. We are already working on a web index named "Torium" which will have games, proxies, movies, and more.
# How do I get roms?
Go to [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VxjINYMDvvUSRKA_k2aJqq6JzmRQCI1s) google drive folder. The team does not own this drive.
# What consoles are there?
Some of the notable ones are, N64, GBA, GBC, GB, SNES, and much more.
